                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
<p>Giant pandas are native to the mountainous regions of China
   and are easily recognized by their distinctive black and white
   fur. They spend most of their day eating bamboo, which makes up
   nearly their entire diet. Pandas are calm and solitary animals
   and are considered a national treasure in China.</p>
<p>Pandas eat for up to 12 hours a day and can eat about 12–38
   kilograms of bamboo daily! Although they belong to the carnivore
   group, they mainly eat plants. Their strong jaws and large molars
   help them crush bamboo stalks with ease.</p>
<p>Panda cubs are born tiny, blind, and without fur.
   They grow quickly with their mother’s care. Pandas are usually 
   shy and solitary, spending their days eating and resting.
   Conservation programs and panda reserves are helping increase
   their population in the wild.</p>
