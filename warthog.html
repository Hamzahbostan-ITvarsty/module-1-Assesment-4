                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
<p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family found in grasslands
   and savannas across Africa. They are known for their large tusks,
   facial "warts," and ability to run fast with their tails sticking up.
   Warthogs feed on grasses, roots, and insects, and often kneel on
   their front legs while grazing.</p>
<p>Warthogs may look fierce, but they are mostly peaceful animals.
   They use their tusks to dig for food and to defend themselves
   if threatened. When danger approaches, they can run fast and
   often dive into burrows backward so they can face attackers
   with their tusks ready.</p>
<p>Warthogs like to roll in mud to stay cool and protect their
   skin from insects. They often share burrows with other animals like mongooses.
   Even though they belong to the pig family, warthogs are tough survivors
   and can live in areas where food and water are hard to find.</p>
