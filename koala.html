                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
 <p>Koalas are tree-dwelling marsupials found in the eucalyptus
    forests of Australia. They sleep up to 18–20 hours a day and
    feed mainly on eucalyptus leaves, which are tough to digest.
    Koalas have strong limbs for climbing and a thick fur coat
    that keeps them warm in cooler weather. Despite their bear-like
    appearance, koalas are not bears at all!</p>
<p>Koalas are marsupials, which means their babies, called joeys,
   grow in their mother's pouch. A baby koala stays in the pouch
   for about six months before riding on its mother’s back.
   Koalas have two thumbs on each hand, which help them grip
   trees and branches as they climb and move through the forest.</p>
<p>Even though koalas look soft and cuddly, they have sharp claws
   and strong muscles to help them stay in trees. They are mostly active
   at night and spend most of their time alone. Due to habitat loss,
   koalas are considered a vulnerable species and need protection to
   survive in the wild.</p>
<p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THE KOALA</p>
<p>You can find them next to the coffee shop</p>
