                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
<p>Monkeys are highly intelligent and social animals that live in
   groups called troops. They use vocalizations, facial expressions,
   and body language to communicate with one another. Monkeys are known
   for their agility and love of climbing, and many species live in
   rainforests where they leap between trees with ease.</p>
<p>There are over 260 species of monkeys, and they are divided
   into two groups: Old World monkeys (from Africa and Asia)
   and New World monkeys (from Central and South America).
   Some monkeys, like spider monkeys, use their tails to swing
   from branches â€” these are called prehensile tails.</p>
<p>Monkeys are very playful and curious. They use tools,
   solve problems, and even recognize themselves in mirrors.
   Some monkeys groom each other to build friendships and keep clean.
   They have a strong sense of community and often live in groups to stay safe from predators.</p>
<p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THE MONKEYS</p>
<p>You can find them at the entrance of the zoo next to the monkey trail</p>
