                    <h3>LION</h3>
<p>Lions are large carnivorous cats known as the "king of the jungle".
   They live in groups called prides, typically made up of related
   females and their offspring, along with a few males. Male lions
   are known for their majestic manes, while lionesses do most
   of the hunting. Lions are native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>Lions are unique among big cats because they live in social groups.
   The lionesses work together to hunt animals like zebras, antelopes,
   and buffalo. Males defend the pride’s territory by roaring loudly
   and marking it with scent. A lion’s roar can be heard up
   to 8 kilometers away!</p>
<p>Cubs are born blind and are cared for by their mothers for the first
   few months of life. As they grow older, they learn how to hunt by watching
   the adults. Lions rest a lot during the day and are more active at night,
   making them nocturnal hunters.</p>
<p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THE LIONS</p>
<p>You can find them behind the pandas canyon below the northern frontier</p>
