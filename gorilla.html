                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
<p>Gorillas are the largest primates and are closely related to humans.
   They live in family groups led by a dominant male called a silverback.
   Gorillas are mostly gentle and shy, feeding on fruits, leaves, and stems.
   They use tools, exhibit emotions, and are highly intelligent animals native
   to the forests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit
   the forests of central sub-Saharan Africa. The eponymous genus Gorilla is 
   divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and 
   either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates by 
   physical size. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans,
   from 95 to 99% depending on what is counted, and they are the next closest
   living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>
<p>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Africa.
   Although their range covers a small percentage of Africa, gorillas cover a
   wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla lives in the Albertine Rift 
   montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 
   2,200 to 4,300 meters (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in 
   dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level.
   Eastern lowland gorillas live in the lowland Congo basin and 
   eastern lowland gorilla in Central West African countries and
   eastern lowland gorillas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
   near its border with Rwanda.</p>
